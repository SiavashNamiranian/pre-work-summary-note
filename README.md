# <Pre-work-summary-note>

## Description

Eversince my first interaction with this magical box in its mainframe format, I had a fascination for computers. Despite my interests, and due to circmstances I pursued Biology for my studies.
After years of doing research and handling noticeable size of data sets, my fascination with computers grew even more. After coming across programing bootcamp, I realized that this could be my chance for redemption. This Pre-work-summary-note is meant to be the gateway to fulfill my life long dream. I had set up this page to not only serve as a milestone that remind me of this journey, but also help me refresh my memory on topics covered up to now. Hopefully anyone visiting this page, would find some useful info on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript topics. This page shows how proper combination of components from those topics can bring a webpage to life.
